# Variable Names
# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).  # nolint
# Rules for R variables are:
# A variable name must start with a letter and can be a combination of letters, digits, period(.) # nolint
# and underscore(_). If it starts with period(.), it cannot be followed by a digit. # nolint
# A variable name cannot start with a number or underscore (_)
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables) # nolint
# Reserved words cannot be used as variables (TRUE, FALSE, NULL, if...)
